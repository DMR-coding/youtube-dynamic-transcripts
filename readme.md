# Interactive YouTube transcripts

## Features
* Show complete transcript for subtitles in selected language.
* Highlight the subtitle that is being spoken.
* Click on text in transcript to jump to the corresponding place in the video.
* Place transcript anywhere on the page where the youtube video is.

If you download the files in this directory and open ytexample.html, you should have a working example. You can also have a look at [http://www.erlendthune.com/yt/ytexample.html](http://www.erlendthune.com/yt/ytexample.html) where these files are unpacked, showing a working example.

To make interactive youtube transcripts work in your own web pages, you must follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have loaded jquery.
2. Load youtube.js
3. Include youtube.css
4. Embed a youtube video as you normally do, but change the following in the iframe code:
  * a) Add an id that equals the id of the video.
  * b) Add ?enablejsapi=1 at the end of the youtube src.
5. Create a `<div>` element with
  * a) an id equal to "videoTranscript" + the video id.
  * b) specify the class "mmoocVideoTranscript".
  * c) add the language of the subitle you want as a "data-language" parameter.
  * d) add, if neccessary the name of the subtitle track as "data-name" parameter. (If you have norwegian subtitles and support
     both bokm√•l and nynorsk, you have to specify this parameter).

If you follow the steps above, your iframe code should look something like this:

~~~~
<iframe id="Lm0m4VtZ3Us" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lm0m4VtZ3Us?enablejsapi=1" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<div id="videoTranscriptLm0m4VtZ3Us" class="mmocVideoTranscript" data-language="no" data-name="bokm&aring;l"></div>
~~~~

The code should normally support embedding several youtube videos and transcripts on the same page (although I have not tested it yet...), but not with the same video id, i.e. not the same video twice on the same page.
